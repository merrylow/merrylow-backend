•	GET /vendor/restaurant vendors can get their own restaurant
•	GET /vendor/products vendors can get their own products
•	PUT /vendor/restaurant/:id → Update their own restaurant details (e.g., name, address, cuisine)
•	POST /vendor/restaurant vendors can create another restaurant( but here, the admin will have to validate it first)
•	POST /vendor/products → Add product // we’ll have to include a bunch of products and their images so that when a vendor tries try to create a product they wouldn’t have to upload any bad photo, but then we’ll fetch one of the images of the product for them….  If a product happens to not appear in our already created lists of products, it means, the vendor will have to wait till their product is approved
•	PUT /vendor/products/:id → Update product
•	DELETE /vendor/products/:id → Remove product
    DELETE /vendor/restaurant/:id -> vendors can decide to delete one of their restaurant...


// vendors can also get products by id.... before they update a product, they'd have to click that product first
//so the endpoint GET /vendor/products/:id should be included
// if vendors have multpiple restaurants, after they click on one, we'd have to get a restaurant based on an id
// so the endpoint GET /vendor/restaurant/:id


all get requests with id's which i am getting from the body should be gotten from the req.query instead

go through all the error handlings and make sure the approapriate messages are sent based on the right error

since we wouldnt want any restaurant to edit another resturants details... we always make sure we fetch data related to that vendor and restaurant alone
so for products when we get products by id, the products would have the restaurants

a solid approach to prevent multiple database call;
// here we fetch the product based on that product id, 
// include the restaurat details, after that we compare if the owner of that restaurant is the vendorId we got

include a simple GET /vendor route which gets the details of the vendor(similar to the auth/me route)


when a user creates as a vendor they can create several restaurants if they want to
but their restaurants will be validated and approved by the admins before it will be added
same happens to adding of new products...


should we add the ownerId to the menu schema??? 
in this case we can validate that the product/menu when an owner/vendor is trying to update actually belongs to them…

when the vendor opens their page/dashboard, should we fetch all the restaurants owned by that vendor and display them setting their ids as the restaurantId so that the frontend can be making request using that id

since vendors can add products specific to a particular restaurant, 
should the endpoint; POST /vendor/products
be updated to this; POST /vendor/products/restaurantId 
or instead the restaurant id is placed in the body when the request is made

should a similar logic be applied to when they try to get a specific product related to one of their restaurant??

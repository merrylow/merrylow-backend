what is the difference between getting current user( userRoute and controller) and account route, controller and service???

maybe getUser only gets the username, image... and some few things... that would be displayed at the top of the homepage
get user could probably handle the user's campus and display the approapriate restaurants....

and get account would be related the user everything... when the user clicks on their image or account in settings....

since the cart will be containing the cart items which will be having their id's...
we make sure when the user selects items to be checkout...
those items should be of the same restaurant

when the items are selected and user clicks checkout
the frontend checkouts with the id of those cartitems
since the calcuations and everything has been done and stored in the cart already\
we fetch the details of the price and every thing and initiate a payment
//which means paystack Functionalities come in play at this point
once payment is made...
we initaite an order with status paid

or should we allow users the option to get their orders first before payment( i don't think so but we'll consider that later)
should users be allowed to edit their items once they are in the cart???
if yes, we'll handle that later...
but atleast they should be allowed to edit the quantity of what they added to the cart
so maybe the checkout request will be made with the payload;
{
  "items": [
    { "carId": "abc123", "quantity": 2 },
    { "cartId": "xyz789", "quantity": 1 }
  ],
  "paymentMethod": "card", // or "mobile_money", "cash_on_delivery"
  "deliveryAddress": "Zigla Mansion, Zigla City "
}
